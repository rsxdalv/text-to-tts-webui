# Kokoro-Based TTS Extension for [Oobabooga Text Generation WebUI](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui)

Enhance your text generation experience with the Kokoro TTS extension, seamlessly integrating with the Oobabooga Text Generation WebUI.

## License

- **Project License:** This extension is released under the [MIT License](LICENSE) and is built upon the [Original Kokoro 82M Inference Code](https://huggingface.co/hexgrad/Kokoro-82M/tree/c97b7bbc3e60f447383c79b2f94fee861ff156ac).

- **Model Weights:** The model weights are **not** covered by the MIT License. They are licensed under the [Apache 2.0 License](https://huggingface.co/hexgrad/Kokoro-82M) and will be directly downloaded from Hugging Face.

## Features

**Current Version:** Kokoro v1
**Supported Languages:** English

Kokoro TTS is limited to inputs up to **510 tokens**. *Note that Kokoro tokens differ from LLM tokens.* This extension allows you to generate longer audio outputs by splitting the input text into segments and concatenating the resulting audio.

## Audio Play
> [!NOTE] 
> Currently, the Audio Play feature is not available in the main branch as it is still in development, but you cansee [here](https://github.com/h43lb1t0/KokoroTtsTexGernerationWebui/blob/personas/Audio_Play.md) how to use it.

Unique TTS voices are assigned to each speaker in dialogue to get a audio play like experience. 

### Text Splitting Methods

- **Split by Sentence:** Divides the text into chunks of complete sentences, each chunk containing fewer than or 510 tokens.
    - This method may fail to split the text into sentences if the input text contains unusual punctuation or formatting. In such cases, the extension will fall back to the "Split by Word" method for this one text.
- **Split by Word:** Divides the text into chunks of individual words, each chunk containing fewer than or 510 tokens.

*I recommend using the "Split by Sentence" method to maintain context and ensure higher quality audio output.*
